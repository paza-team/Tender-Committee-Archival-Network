# Tender-Committee-Archival-Network

This is a Blockchain network built using Hyperledger Fabric to offer a digital archival network of the committee meeting.

## Problem

Records of committee meetings involved in the procurement process are largely disjointed and present significant challenges when adducing them as evidence in court either on account of their credibility or illegibility. Members of tender committees either fail to sign minutes of commitee meetings or erroneously sign on behalf of others presenting challenges in adducing the minutes as evidence and glaring integrity issues in the procurement process while at the committee stage.

The committees are responsible for determining the winners of a procurement contract. In court, the minutes are used to determine whether the procurement process was procedural when committee members face  corruption charges which go hand in hand with economic crimes e.g willful failure to follow procurement laws.

These minutes are vital in the criminal justice process because it is by adducing evidence that one can prove a charge (crime was committed). It can also be used in creative ways such as enforcing asset recovery during plea bargaining and deferred prosecution agreements.

## Solution

Digitize tender-committee meeting minutes to bring more transparency to the committee process, evaluation and report. Hyperledger Fabric is distributed ledger that can be used to get past agencies silos and therefore, the state of the committeeâ€™s evaluations and report can be shared between different government agencies and/or other third-parties, participating actively or passively in the tendering process.

Anonymous reporting for members of the committee who may have been approached to by pass the legal procurement process in favour of a specific tenderer.
