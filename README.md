# Tender-Committee-Archival-Network

This is a Blockchain network built using hyperledger fabric to offer a digital archival network for committee meeting minutes.

## Problem

Records of committee meetings involved in the procurement process are largely disjointed and present significant challenges when adducing them as evidence in court either on account of their credibility or illegibility. Members of tender committees either fail to sign minutes of commitee meetings or erroneously sign on behalf of others presenting challenges in adducing the minutes as evidence and glaring integrity issues in the procurement process while at the committee stage.

The committees are responsible for determining the winners of a procurement contract. In court, the minutes are used to determine whether the procurement process was procedural when committee members face  corruption charges which go hand in hand with economic crimes e.g willful failure to follow procurement laws.

These minutes are vital in the criminal justice process because it is by adducing evidence that one can prove a charge (crime was committed). It can also be used in creative ways such as enforcing asset recovery during plea bargaining and deferred prosecution agreements.

## Solution

Digitize tender-committee meeting minutes to bring more transparency by improving record keeping with the use of Hyperledger Fabric build a distributed ledger of the storing the state of the committiee meeting and will be shared between different goverment agencies and/or other third-parties, participating in the tendering process.

The minutes, video and/or audio, its transcription and other relevant documents are stored in the block in the form of url links to the remote file storage.

Anonymous reporting for members of the committee who may have been approached to by pass the legal procurement process in favour of a specific tenderer.
